  message:
  - 
  - hey sorry I dropped off of social media for a bit. How are you?
  - 
  - happy birthday! hope you're doing well!
  - 
  - hey thanks dude, I didn't expect you to remember
  - sorry I haven't been the best at responding to messages
  - hope you're doing well too
  - Hey!
  - also ofc I remembered!
  - or at least my phone remembered for me but whatever I was the one who put it
    in
  - oh lol thanks
  - sorry if I woke you up or soemthing, i wasnt expecting you to be on tbh
  - oh no worries I'm up pretty late
  - insomnia is wild
  - oh damn. that sucks
  - yeah but im trying to use it to my advantage to like catch up on studying and
    stuff
  - I have to make up for the time I was on probation
  - ...academic probation right? not like... a criminal sentence?
  - yeah it was this or prison
  - oh man sorry
  - no im kidding. sorry, stupid joke.
  - I was just struggling with my classes because I was apparently like clinically
    depressed.
  - 'oh. '
  - rip.
  - that still sucks.
  - yeah I had to take a year off just to clear my head
  - well one year accidentally became two but
  - it was what I needed I think.
  - Like I'm not at 100% but much better than before
  - thats good
  - yeah turns out talking to people helps or something :D
  - like therapy? that's what everyone always recommends
  - yeah therapy works to an extent but its expensive ngl
  - but i was referring more to like not keeping all my problems to myself in general
  - idk about you but I alwauys feel like im bothering people
  - but someone told me that asking for help doesnt make you a toxic friend especially
    if ppl are openly asking to listen
  - and honestly? just explaining to someone that I was struggling somehow made it
    seem like the world wasn't going to end just because I was failing all my classes?
  - like yeah i WAS failing all my classes but for a moment it wasn't like the whole
    world was collapsing you know?
  - 'yeah. '
  - i think.
  - 'but yeah how about you? not prying but i think you said you were having a rough
    year '
  - years?
  - not calling you out or anything, just throwing it out there that im open to chatting
    in case you need someone to listen.
  - yeah ig
  - I um
  - thanks man, that means a lot
  - i guess i just
  - idk yet how much is even worth talking about.
  - yeah that's fair
  - I guess I feel like it was so much worse before but now I'm just sort of... numb?
  - like
  - like i knew something was wrong when normal tired became exhausted all the time
    but like
  - 'now im just sort of apathetic 50% of the time '
  - like all the stuff that was overwhelming before is just noise
  - I know I still have anxiety and stuff probably but its just weird because there
    are days when I feel like I'm floating and detached from it all.
  - like I have no motivation to do anything and time is just one big endless blob
    of nothing but then some days the anxiety comes back in in full force and everything
    feels so urgent and awful and I just crawl into bed and have a big sad day
  - I mean more than I usually do
  - sorry you probably dont want to hear this
  - 'no dude, i do! '
  - really like its important to talk about this kind of stuff
  - 'honestly it might not help you as much as it did for me bc idk everyone''s experiences
    are different '
  - but if it'll help even a little then i'm going to listen as much as you need
    me to
  - hope thats cool i know we literally havent talked in like two years
  - 'yeah no thanks man '
  - i mean my sister said the same thing but I haven't been able to bring anything
    up to her but
  - 'just having someone sending memes and '
  - ' money for pizza and stuff but'
  - oh nice free pizza
  - yeah lol idk its kind of worked in a way
  - glad to hear it tbh
  - honestly dude, I'm proud of you for making it this far.
  - haha its not like ive achieved anything special or
  - nah man, like just surviving the day to day. that stuff is harder than anyone
    ever tells you
  - yeah
  - 'thanks. '
  - its weird like i don't think i could have taken that to heart before but
  - thanks.
  - k i think im going to go to bed but
  - yeah for sure dont let me keep you
  - it was great to talk
  - 'happy to catch up for real when you get the chance '
  - like i didnt even tell you that i blew up my microwave
  - yeaaaah okay. thats what we're starting with next time
  - night
  - night!
  - and happy birthday again!
